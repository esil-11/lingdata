### Overview:

This is a phonetics-themed roguelike game for a programming project. It is built with ___Python___ using object-oriented programming. The development followed this tutorial *(http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)* and used mainly the ___tcod___ library, as well as some others.
